# Playing Card Detection and Identification

## Introduction

This project involves the detection and identification of playing cards from an image using Python and OpenCV. The system captures images of playing cards, processes them to detect card contours, and matches them to template images to identify the rank and suit of each card.

## Objectives

- Develop a method to detect and identify playing cards from an image.
- Optimize system performance by relying on the similarity between template images and patches in the transformed card image.

## Methodology

### 1. Image Acquisition
- Frames are captured from a webcam using OpenCV (`cv2.VideoCapture`).
- The parameters are initialized, and an initial image is loaded for manipulation.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Apply a Gaussian filter to blur the image.
- Convert the grayscale image into a binary image based on intensity levels using `cv2.threshold`.

### 3. Edge Detection
- Use Canny edge detection to find edges in the image.

### 4. Contour Detection
- Find contours and sort them by contour size.
- Determine which of the contours are cards based on specific criteria (size, shape, etc.).

### 5. Perspective Transformation
- Use the card's perimeter to approximate corner points and find the width and height of the card's bounding rectangle.
- Perform a perspective transformation to get a top-down view of the card.

### 6. Feature Extraction
- Split the card image into rank and suit images.
- Extract the rank and suit by isolating the respective regions.

### 7. Matching
- Match the extracted rank and suit images to the template images.
- Combine the best rank and suit matches to identify the card.
